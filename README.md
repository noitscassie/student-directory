# student-directory

The is a command line student directory script that allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy. The script is the culmination of week three work in the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) pre-course.

The instructions for the week specify that the user should be able to save and load lists of students, as well as add new ones and print the full list. I have added additional options to allow the user to modify the name and cohort, as well as delete, existing students. 

To all of the students at Villains Academy, happy mischief-making!
